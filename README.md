# Resources for Programming

## Library Documentation

[2019 FRC Control System (WPILib Screensteps)](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485)

Basic documentation for WPILib Libary, Driverstation / RoboRIO Setup, & Other WPIlib Tools (e.g., SmartDashboard, PathWeaver, Network Tables, & FRCVision for Raspberry Pi).

[CTR-Electronics Phoenix Software Documentation](https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/)

Documentation for CTR-Electronics software framework. This framework is used to control the Talon SRX motor controller. Make sure to check out the [Closed-Loop Control](https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch16_ClosedLoop.html) features.

[Java | navX-MXP - Kauai Labs](https://pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/roborio-libraries/java/)

Documentation for the NavX Robotics Navigation Sensor's software library. Make sure to check out the [AHRS javadocs](https://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/navx-mxp/apidocs/java/com/kauailabs/navx/frc/AHRS.html) to find out how to use the gyroscope in your code.

## Presentations

[Motion Planning & Control in FRC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8319J1BEHwM)

Lead software mentors from championship winning teams 254 and 971 explain multiple methods for accurately controlling motion. Watch this first before attempting to use the TalonSRX's Motion Magic or use PID Control on your subsystems to get an idea of how they work. (59 minutes)

[Developing a Real-Time Vision App for Target Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsuZq1mvwio)

Programmers from championship finalist team 195 explain their vision tracking system. It is quite a bit more complex than what you need to do to make a simple vision tracking application, but they explain the general ideas behind it and provide tips for how to improve the tracking. (98 minutes)

## Other things

[GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

How to work collaboratively on a github project. If you have more than 2 programmers I would recommend looking into this so you can keep your code organized and prevent costly mistakes. It worked very well for us in 2018 when we had 4 programmers. Make sure to pick someone to be the project leader. They can review pull requests and merge them into the main project.
